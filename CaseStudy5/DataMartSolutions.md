## Case Study Questions
The following case study questions require some data cleaning steps before we start to unpack Dannyâ€™s key business questions in more depth.

### A. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:
* convert the `week_date` to a DATE format
* add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
* add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
* add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
* add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
	* 1	Young Adults
	* 2	Middle Aged
	* 3 or 4 Retirees
* add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
	* C	Couples
	* F	Families
* ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the `new age_band` and `demographic` columns
* generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the `sales` value divided by `transactions` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;
CREATE TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS
  (SELECT 
     TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD-MM-YY') AS date,
     DATE_PART('week', (TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD-MM-YY'))) AS week_number,
     DATE_PART('month', (TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD-MM-YY'))) AS month,
     DATE_PART('year', (TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD-MM-YY'))) AS year,
     region,
     platform,
     customer_type,
     segment,
     CASE WHEN RIGHT(segment, 1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults' 
          WHEN RIGHT(segment, 1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'  
          WHEN RIGHT(segment, 1) = '3' OR  RIGHT(segment, 1) = '4' THEN 'Retirees'  
          ELSE 'Unknown'  
           END  
        AS age_band,
     CASE WHEN LEFT(segment, 1) = 'C' THEN 'Couples' 
          WHEN LEFT(segment, 1) = 'F' THEN 'Families' 
          ELSE 'Unknown' 
           END 
        AS demographics,
     transactions,
     sales,
     ROUND(sales / transactions::DECIMAL, 2) AS avg_transactions
  FROM data_mart.weekly_sales
  )
```

       WHEN segment = 'F1' THEN 'Young Adult Families' 
       WHEN segment = 'F2' THEN 'Middled Aged Families' 
       WHEN segment = 'F3' OR 
            segment = 'F4' THEN 'Retiree Families'

**9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?**  
Outside of specific use cases, it is always best practice to calculate the average directly, rather than taking the average of an average. 

Let's compare a newly calculated average:
```sql
SELECT
  r.year,
  r.avg_sale_amount AS retail_avg_sale,
  s.avg_sale_amount AS shopify_avg_sale
FROM
  (SELECT
     year,
     ROUND(SUM(sales) / SUM(transactions)::DECIMAL, 2) AS avg_sale_amount
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     platform = 'Retail'
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) r
JOIN
  (SELECT
     year,
     ROUND(SUM(sales) / SUM(transactions)::DECIMAL, 2) AS avg_sale_amount
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     platform = 'Shopify'
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) s
ON r.year = s.year
```
| year | retail_avg_sale | shopify_avg_sale |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 2018 | 36.56           | 192.48           |
| 2019 | 36.83           | 183.36           |
| 2020 | 36.56           | 179.03           |

With the average of the average:
```sql
SELECT
  r.year,
  r.avg_transactions AS retail_avg_avg,
  s.avg_transactions AS shopify_avg_avg
FROM
  (SELECT
     year,
     ROUND(AVG(avg_transactions), 2) AS avg_transactions
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     platform = 'Retail'
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) r
JOIN
  (SELECT
     year,
     ROUND(AVG(avg_transactions), 2) AS avg_transactions
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     platform = 'Shopify'
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) s
ON r.year = s.year
```
| year | retail_avg_avg | shopify_avg_avg |
| ---- | -------------- | --------------- |
| 2018 | 42.91          | 188.28          |
| 2019 | 41.97          | 177.56          |
| 2020 | 40.64          | 174.87          |

### C. Before & After Analysis
This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

**1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?**
```sql
WITH pr4 AS
  (SELECT
     SUM(sales) AS prechange_sales
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     date BETWEEN '2020-06-15'::DATE - INTERVAL '4 weeks' AND
                  '2020-06-15'::DATE - INTERVAL '1 week'
  ),
po4 AS
  (SELECT
     SUM(sales) AS postchange_sales
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     date BETWEEN '2020-06-15'::DATE AND
                  '2020-06-15'::DATE + INTERVAL '3 weeks'
  )
SELECT
  prechange_sales,
  postchange_sales,
  postchange_sales - prechange_sales AS sales_change,
  ROUND((postchange_sales - prechange_sales)::DECIMAL / 
          prechange_sales * 100, 2) || '%' 
     AS percentage_change
FROM
  pr4,
  po4
```
| prechange_sales | postchange_sales | sales_change | percentage_change |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 2345878357      | 2318994169       | -26884188    | -1.15%            |

**2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**
```sql
WITH pr12 AS
  (SELECT
     SUM(sales) AS prechange_sales
   FROM clean_weekly_sales

**3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**  
For this question, we'll first want to determine what week_number corresponds to the date of the changes made by Data Mart.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  date,
  week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE
  date = '2020-06-15'
```
| date                     | week_number |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 2020-06-15T00:00:00.000Z | 25          |

With this information, we can modify the above queries to include weeks in the desired ranges for each year.
We'll start with the 4 weeks before and after the change:
```sql
SELECT
  yopr4.year,
  yopr4.presales AS sales_weeks_21to24,
  yopo4.postsales AS sales_weeks_25to28,
  yopo4.postsales - yopr4.presales AS sales_change,
  ROUND((yopo4.postsales - yopr4.presales)::DECIMAL / yopr4.presales * 100, 2) || '%' AS percentage_change
FROM
  (SELECT
     year,
     SUM(sales) AS presales
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     week_number BETWEEN (25 - 4) AND
                         (25 - 1)
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) yopr4
JOIN
  (SELECT
     year,
     SUM(sales) AS postsales
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     week_number BETWEEN 25 AND
                        (25 + 3)
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) yopo4
ON yopr4.year = yopo4.year
```
| year | sales_weeks_21to24 | sales_weeks_25to28 | sales_change | percentage_change |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 2018 | 2125140809         | 2129242914         | 4102105      | 0.19%             |
| 2019 | 2249989796         | 2252326390         | 2336594      | 0.10%             |
| 2020 | 2345878357         | 2318994169         | -26884188    | -1.15%            |

Now, the full 12 weeks before and after the change.
```sql
SELECT
  yopr12.year,
  yopr12.presales AS sales_weeks_13to24,
  yopo12.postsales AS sales_weeks_25to36,
  yopo12.postsales - yopr12.presales AS sales_change,
  ROUND((yopo12.postsales - yopr12.presales)::DECIMAL / yopr12.presales * 100, 2) || '%' AS percentage_change
FROM
  (SELECT
     year,
     SUM(sales) AS presales
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     week_number BETWEEN (25 - 12) AND
                         (25 - 1)
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) yopr12
JOIN
  (SELECT
     year,
     SUM(sales) AS postsales
   FROM clean_weekly_sales
   WHERE
     week_number BETWEEN 25 AND
                        (25 + 11)
   GROUP BY
     year
  ) yopo12
ON yopr12.year = yopo12.year
```
| year | sales_weeks_13to24 | sales_weeks_25to36 | sales_change | percentage_change |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 2018 | 6396562317         | 6500818510         | 104256193    | 1.63%             |

**2. Do you have any further recommendations for Dannyâ€™s team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?**  
The `customer_type` query indicates that there was growth among new customers in the 12 weeks following the sustainability changes, while sales reduction occured for both existing and guest customer types. If we were to combine `customer_type` with `platform` the following results shed more light on the situation:
```sql
SELECT
  cpr.platform,
  cpr.customer_type,
  cpr.presales AS prechange_sales,
  cpo.postsales AS postchange_sales,
  cpo.postsales - cpr.presales AS sales_change,

As we see, retail sales suffered more heavily than shopify, especially in relation to existing customers and guests. This may indicate that packaging changes were not well advertised ahead of the change, isolating familiar customers from the brand and leading to sales loss due to unfamiliar packaging. If Data Mart's Shopify works like other online shops, the "buy again" feature can help customers overcome packaging changes that they may not otherwise recognise in a brick-and-mortar store without closer inspection.

For future changes, advertising ahead of time or including a label on the package for a certain period of time after the change (same product, different label type deal) will help alert customers to branding changes and prepare them for finding the product on the shelves when shopping.

Additionally, we know from one of the earlier queries that, of the known demographics and age_bands, Retirees contribute the most to Retail sales. However, with additional inspection looking at all `age_band` groups and only the existing `customer_type` we actually find that, again of the known customers, both loss of sales in Retail shops and growth through Shopify can be contributed most to the Middle Aged `age_band`.

| -------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Retail   | Existing      | Middle Aged  | 893886904       | 866119309        | -27767595    | -3.11%            |

 This is especially helpful when determining what key demographics should be targeted for marketing campaigns, especially ahead of branding changes. If an existing customer consents to receive promotional communications, send reminders or even small samples in the new packaging ahead of release to help ensure loyal customers are aware of the coming changes. 
 
Finally, while year-over-year Retail has shown a downward sales trend, even before sustainability changes, Shopify has shown consistent growth and may be worth exploring further among key demographics as a major growth potential.
